## üíº Economy: Strong, Stable, and Growing

Qatar‚Äôs economy has demonstrated remarkable strength in recent years. After the COVID-19 dip in 2020, key indicators bounced back sharply:

- GDP: $218bn in 2024, up 2.3% vs PY

- GDP per Capita: $76.28K, one of the highest globally

- Inflation: Reduced to 1.27%, a 4.9% drop from previous year

- Unemployment: Among the lowest worldwide at just 0.13%

- FDI (% of GDP): Fluctuating trend, recently stabilizing after pandemic-era volatility

**Insight: Qatar is less dependent on remittances and foreign capital inflow ‚Äî its internal production, especially energy exports, drives the economy.
   The rebound post-2020 highlights economic resilience, policy strength, and long-term stability.**

## Population: Resilient Recovery, High Quality of Life

The population narrative is one of both challenge and comeback:

- Population: 2.86 million in 2024, with 7.32% growth vs 2023

- Life Expectancy: Recovered to 82 years in 2024

- Unemployment: Declined to 0.13%, reinforcing economic stability

- Intentional Homicide Rate: Just 0.33 per 100,000 in 2023 ‚Äî one of the safest countries globally

- Net Migration: Sharp dip of ‚Äì50K in 2020, but recovering as of 2024

**Insight: Qatar‚Äôs low crime, strong healthcare, and stable labor market contribute to a high quality of life. 
The sharp COVID-induced migration drop has reversed, with renewed workforce inflow and population momentum.**

## Why This Project?

As a data analyst passionate about storytelling and development analytics, The Qatari Dream was a special one for me. Walking through the streets of Doha, I was genuinely amazed by how advanced the infrastructure was and how well-organized everything seemed. The welfare systems, the modern architecture, and the overall environment made me curious about the data behind Qatar‚Äôs growth. This project gave me a chance to explore that curiosity and tell a story through the numbers.
